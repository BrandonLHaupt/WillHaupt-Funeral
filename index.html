                    Willard Lee Haupt, affectionately known as "Raticus," left
                    this world on May 8, 2025, in St. Louis, Missouri, at the
                    age of 61. Born on October 23, 1963, in Peoria, Illinois, he
                    embraced life with a joyful spirit that touched everyone
                    around him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Willard dedicated his career to Boeing, where he worked as
                    an F-15 Assembly Mechanic, proudly contributing to something
                    larger than himself. His legacy goes beyond his professional
                    achievements to a life filled with laughter and love for his
                    family. Known for his fun-loving nature and sharp sense of
                    humor, he was a true jovial jokester who never met a
                    stranger. With a smile and a story ready to share, Willard's
                    presence brought warmth and delight to all who had the
                    pleasure of knowing him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surrounded by his beloved family and friends, he created
                    countless cherished memories, whether it was making 7 and
                    7’s at the pool or enjoying the soothing sunset while
                    grilling at his favorite Sunday Night Dinners. Willard found
                    immense joy in the little things — from fishing and hunting
                    to swimming and gaming. He adored playing video games,
                    spending sunny days at the beach, and enjoyed wonderful
                    moments at the pool with those nearest to his heart.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the center of his world were his children: Alexandria
                    (Ryan) Muzzey, Brandon (Angela) Haupt, and Courtney Haupt.
                    He beamed with pride for his grandchildren, Grace Rekosh,
                    Lyla Muzzey, and Logan Muzzey, who filled his life with joy
                    and purpose. He also deeply loved and was very proud of his
                    best friend and companion, Nancy Haupt, the mother of his
                    children. His fondness extended to his granddog, Peaches,
                    reflecting the love he had for all furry companions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Willard’s loving spirit is carried on by his dear mother,
                    Carolyn Timmons, his brother Ron (Shannon) Haupt, and a
                    loving network of in-laws, including Jim and Brenda
                    Lawrence, along with brothers and sisters-in-law, Tracey and
                    Tina Lawrence, Jamie Ellison and Joe Smith, Stacey and Roy
                    Poteete, Jimmy Stratmann, Phyllis and Paul Kaltenbach. He
                    was also an adoring uncle to his nieces and nephews:
                    Ashleigh (Kevin) Hummel, Christy Kestner (and her children,
                    Mason, Jordan, and Taylor), TJ Lawrence, Mackenzie Ellison,
                    Hunter Ellison, Caleb Haupt, Peyton Haupt, Chloe Haupt,
                    Audra Haupt, Connor Haupt, Harper Preston, and Samuel
                    Preston-Haupt, as well as a caring cousin to Gina Timmons
                    and Becky Timmons. His best friend, Scott "Super" Knapp,
                    stood by him faithfully, embodying the spirit of the
                    friendships that Willard treasured deeply.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As we celebrate Willard's life, we remember the joy he
                    brought into our lives and the laughter that reverberated
                    around him. He was stubborn in a loving way, always sharing
                    his opinions with confidence, yet he cared fiercely for
                    those he loved. Willard's proudest accomplishments will
                    always be rooted in his family — the bonds he built and the
                    love he nurtured.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He is preceded in death by his father, Donald Krauss, his
                    brothers, Brad Haupt, Montie Haupt, and Donald Haupt, as
                    well as his grandparents and his favorite aunt, Joyce
                    Stratmann. Though he has departed from this life, the
                    laughter, love, and light he shared will forever resonate in
                    the hearts of family and friends.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A visitation to honor Willard will take place on May 15,
                    2025, from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM and again on May 16, 2025,
                    from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM at Newcomer Funeral Home, St.
                    Peters, MO. A funeral service will follow on May 16, 2025,
                    starting at 1:00 PM, with a graveside service scheduled for
                    2:30 PM at Zion Lutheran Church Cemetery in St. Charles, MO.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Willard Lee Haupt’s spirit will continue to shine brightly
                    through the lives he touched, especially through his adoring
                    family, whose memories of him are imbued with love and
                    laughter. His legacy of joy will be celebrated by all who
                    knew him.
